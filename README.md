This is where I will post my ohbot showtapes that are unfinished but being worked on. You can see the progress being made as I update the file. These will be coded in python using the ohbot library.
The final versions will be clearly marked and also posted on my [ohbot showtapes repository](https://github.com/Ciaralooney/ohbotshowtapes/blob/main/README.md)
